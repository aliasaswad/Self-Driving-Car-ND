**Figure 1:** Color options: A, B, C

1\. Considering the colors pictured above, in HLS color space, which of these options will have the _lowest_ L value?

- A

**Explanation**: L stands for Lightness and it's a measure of how light or dark a color is. Of these three colors, all of them have the same value for hue and saturation, but the darkest color (option A) has the lowest value for lightness and the lightest color (option C) has the highest value for lightness.

2\. Considering the same three images, in which of the HLS color channels will these three images have approximately the same value?

- H
