# Quiz Solution: Intuitions

Here's a matching challenge to test your intuition about camera calibration, distortion and perspective transforms. Drag the answers to the appropriate location in the column on the right.

To measure the orientation angles of objects in an image:

| Process | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| Camera Calibration | To compute the transformation between 3D object points in the world and 2D image points. |
| Distortion Correction | To ensure that the geometrical shape of objects is represented consistently, no matter where they appear in an image. |
| Perspective Tranform | To transform an image such that we are effectively viewing objects from a different angle or direction. |
