# Quiz: Curvature and Perspective

There are various reasons you might want to perform a perspective transform on an image, but in the case of the road images taken from our front-facing camera on a car, why are we interested in doing a perspective transform?

Choose only one answer:

- Because it is more straightforward to take a gradient on a top-down view of the road image.
- Because ultimately we want to measure the curvature of the lines, and to do that we need to transform to a top-down view.
- Because transforming the perspectve removes the effect of curvature from our measurement.
- Because transforming the perspective removes the effect of shadows and color differences from our road image.
