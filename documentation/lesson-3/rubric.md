# Project Specification

## Finding Lane Lines on the Road

### Required Files

| Criteria | Meets Specifications |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Have all project files been included with the submission? | The project submission includes all required files: **1.** Ipython notebook with code and **2.** A writeup report (either pdf or markdown). |

### Lane Finding Pipeline

| Criteria | Meets Specifications |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Does the pipeline for line identification take road images from a video as input and return an annotated video stream as output? | The output video is an annotated version of the output video. |
| Has a pipeline been implemented that uses the helper functions and/or other code to roughly identify the left and right lane lines with either line segments or solid lines? (example solution included in the repository output: raw-lines-example.mp4) | In a rough sense, the left and right lane lines are accurately annotated throughout almost all of the video. Annotations can be segemented or solid lines. |
| Have detected line segments been filtered / averaged / extrapolated to map out the full extent of the left and right lane boundaries? (example solution included in the repository: P1_example.mp4) | Visually, the left and right lane lines are accurately annotated by solid lines throughout most of the video. |

### Reflection

| Criteria | Meets Specifications |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Has a thoughtful reflection on the project been provided in the notebook? | Reflection describes the current pipeline, identifies its potential shortcomings and suggests possible improvements. There is no minimum length. Writing in English is preferred but you may use any language. |
