# Project: Finding Lane Lines

Write code to identify lane lines on the road. First in an image and later in a video stream.

## Building a Portfolio

We now let you work on data obtained in California, image data to do lane finding. The data is obtained from a highway called 280, which is a verry scenic California highway. 

This is done for 2 reasons: one is to sharpen your tools, understand, learn and practice how to be effective in lane marking findings and lane finding and the second is becausee we want you to also begin assembling your portfolio.

Employers love looking at student portfolios. Having worked on real data with real results is typically very, very impressive. So, take this unit seriously and do a great job.

## Project Intro

In the lesson building up to this project, you've used image analysis technique like Canny edge detection and Hough transforms to find lane lines in images. These are the exact techniques you will need for this project.

Your goal for this project is to write a software pipeline to identify and track the position of the lane lines in a video stream. A video is a series of images, so you already have the tools you need to do this project.

This project is one of the first steps in becoming a self-driving car engineer.

## Project Expectations

For each project, keep in mind a few elements:

- rubric
- code
- writeup
- submission

### Rubric

Each project comes with a rubric detailing the requirements for passing the project. Project reviewers will check your project against the rubric to make sure that it meets specifications.

Before submitting your project, compare your submission against the rubric to make sure you've covered each rubric point.

### Code

Every project includes code that you will write. Some projects will have code templates provided in a Jupyter notebook.

You will need to submit your code files as part of the project. Each project has specific instructions about what files are required. Make sure your code is commented and easy for the project reviewers to follow.

For the Jupyter notebook, sometimes you must run all of the code cells, then export the notebook as an HTML file. The notebook will contain instructions for how to do this.

Because running the code can take anywhere from several minutes to a few hours, the HTML file allows project reviewers to see your notebook's output without having to run the code.

Even if the project requires submission of the HTML output of your Jupyter notebook, please submit the original Jupyter notebook itself too.

### Writeup

All the projects require a writeup. The writeup is your chance to explain how you approached the project.

It is also an opportunity to show your understanding of key concepts in the program.

We have provided writeup templates for every project so it is clear what information needs to be in each writeup. These templates can be found in each project repository with title `writeup_template.md`.

Your writeup report should explain how you satisfied each requirement in the project rubric.

The writeups can be turned in either as Markdown files (.md) or PDF files.

### README

GitHub repositories are a convenient way to organize your projects and display them to the world. A GitHub repository also has a README.md that opens automatically when somebody visits your GitHub  repository link.

As a suggestion, the README.md file for each repository can include the following information:

- an overview of the project
- a list of files contained in the repository with a brief description of each file
- any instructions someone might need for running your code

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, Udacity has a brief **[GitHub tutorial](https://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html)**. Udacity also provides a more detailed free course **[Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)**.

To learn about README files and Markdown, Udacity provides free course **[Writing READMEs](https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777)**.

GitHub also provides a tutorial **[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)**.

## Project Instructions

### Local Setup Users Start Here

Navigate to the GitHub project repository [P1-Finding-Lane-Lines-CarND](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1), look at the README file for detailed instructions on how to get setup with Python and OpenCV and how to access the Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.

If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, check out this Udacity primar **[Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1111)**.

### Commit to GitHub

Students are highly encouraged to commit their project to a GitHub repo.

### Evaluation

Once you have completed your project, use the [Project Rubric](rubric.md) to review the project. If you have covered all of the points in the rubric, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in **any** category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working!

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same **Project Rubric**. Your project must "meet specifications" in order for your submission to pass.

### Ready to submit your project?

**Local Setup Users**

You can eitherr submit your project as a link to a GitHub repository or as a ZIP file. When submitting a GitHub repository, we advise creating a new repository, specific to the project you are submitting.

### Project Support

If you are stuck or having difficulties with the project, don't lose hope! Talk to your mentors and fellow students in your Study Group as well as ask and answer questions tagged with the project name.

## Share your project success

Passed your project? Share the good news!

What you've accomplished is no small feat. Give yourself a pat on the back and some well-deserved recognition by sharing your success with your network.
