# Quiz: Hough Transform

Experiment with the Hough Transform on an edge-detected image. When you run the starter code you will get output image that looks like the **edge detection and Hough transform** image. Your goal is to modify the parameters for the Hough Transform and impose a region of interest mask to get output that looks like the **parameters optimized and region masked** image.
