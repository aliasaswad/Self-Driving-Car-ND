What is the representation of two points in Image Space in Hough Space?

- A
- B
- **C**
- D

**C** is the answer. Two points in image space correspond to two lines in Hough Space. Why must these lines intersect? I believe these lines must intersect because they have differernt slopes and in the image space the points are not positioned above each other, but are diagonally across from each other.
