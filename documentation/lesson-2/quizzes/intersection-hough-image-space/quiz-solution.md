We have two intersecting lines in Hough Space.

What does the intersection point of the two lines in Hough space correspond to in image space?

- **A) A line in image space that passes through both (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)**
- B) A line in image space that passes between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
- C) A line in image space that passes through (x1, y1)
- D) A line in image space that passes through only (x2, y2)

**A** is the answer. The intersection point at (m0, b0) represents the line `y = m0x + b0` in image space and it must be the line that passes through both points.
