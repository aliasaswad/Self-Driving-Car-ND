If a **line** in image space corresponds to a **point** in Hough space, what would **two parallel lines** in image space correspond to in Hough space?

- A
- B
- **C**
- D

**C** is the answer. Parallel lines have the same slope, which is the same "m" parameter in our line model. So, in parameter space, two parallel lines would be represented by two points at the same value, but different b values.
