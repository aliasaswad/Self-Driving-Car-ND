# Neural Networks

Build and train neural networks from linear and logistic regression to backpropagation and multilayer perceptron networks.

## Neural Network Intuition

Perhaps the hottest topic right now is Artificial Intelligence and when people talk about this, they usually mean Machine Learning, specifically neural networks.

Neural networks should be familiar to you, a big neural network is your brain, which has 10 to the 11 neurons. What people have done in the last decades kind of abstracted this big mass in your brain into a basis of equations that emulate a network of artificial neurons. Then people have invented ways to train these systems based on data. So, rather than instructing a machine with rules like a piece of software, these neural networks are trained based on data.

So, you're going to learn the basics now: perceptron, backpropagation, terminology that doesn't make sense yet, but by the end of this unit you should be able to write and code and train your own neural network.

## Introduction to Deep Learning

Here you're going to learn one of the most exciting tools in self-driving car development, deep neural networks. At the end of this module, you'll create a project that demonstrates real world application of the skills you need to become a self-driving car engineer.

In the project, you'll train a deep neural network to drive a car in a simulator. First you'll drive and record training laps in simulation and then you'll build and train a deep neural network that learns from the way you drive.

A deep neural network is just a term that describes a big multi-layer neural network. A neural network is a machine learning algorithm that you can train using input like camera images or sensor readings and generate output like what the steering angle the car should take or how fast it should go. The idea is the neural network learns from observing the world. You don't have to teach it anything specific.

Deep learning is just another term for using deep neural networks to problems and it's become really important for self-driving cars. But deep learning is relatively new, until the last few years, computers simply weren't fast enough to train deep neural networks effectively. Now however, automotive manufacturers can apply deep learning techniques to drive cars in real time.

Because deep learning is so new, automotive engineers and researchers are still experimenting with just how far it can take us, but deep learning has already revolutionized segments of autonomous driving like computer vision and it has the potential to entirely change the way we develop self-driving cars.

## Starting Machine Learning

Some of the most recent breakthroughs in the performance of self-driving cars have come from machine learning. Two of my Udacity colleagues: Luis and Mat are machine learning experts. In this lesson, they are going to introduce you to the foundational concepts in the fields of machine learning and deep neural networks. Afterward, we'll build on those concepts and apply them to self-driving cars.

Luis Serrano leads the Machine Learning Nanodegree program at Udacity. Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence that relies on computers to learn about the environment from data instead of relying on the rules set by computer programmers.

Mat Leonard leads the Deep Learning Nanodegree program. Deep learning is an approach to machine learning that uses deep neural networks. Deep learning uses this one tool to accomplish an amazing array of objectives from speech recognition to driving a car.

You'll start learning about the perceptron, which is the fundamental unit of a neural network. Then you'll learn how to combine these units into a simple neural network. Before you start learning about neural networks, let's go over the basics of machine learning.

We'll get started with something less complex than self-driving cars. Housing prices.
