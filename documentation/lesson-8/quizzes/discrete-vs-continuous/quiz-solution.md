# Quiz Solution: Discrete vs Continuous

The sigmoid function is defined as `sigmoid(x) = 1/(1+e^(-x))`. If the score is defined by `4x1 + 5x2 - 9 = score`, then which of the following points has exactly a 50% probability of being blue or red? (Choose all that are correct.)

- (1, 1)
- (-4, 5)

**Explanation**: Intuitively, if you look at the plot for a sigmoid function, the probability would always be 50% if the score evaluates to 0.
