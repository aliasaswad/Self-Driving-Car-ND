Now you know the equation for the line (2X1 + X2 - 18 = 0) and similarly the "score" (2X1 + X2 - 18), what is the score of the student who got 7 in the test and 6 for grades?

We can use the **Score** equation:

~~~
Score  = 2*Test + Grades - 18

Score = 2*(7) + 6 - 18
Score = 2
~~~

So, the **Score = 2**.
