# Quiz: XOR Perceptron

The following table of 0s and 1s is returned, but can we turn it into a XOR perceptron?

## Build an XOR Multi-Layer Perceptron

Let's build a multi-layer perceptron from the AND, NOT and OR perceptrons to create XOR logic!

The neural network below contains 3 perceptrons: A, B, C. The last one (AND) has been given for you. The input to the neural network is from the first node. The output comes out of the last node.

The multi-layer perceptron below calculates XOR. Each perceptron is a logic operation of AND, OR and NOT. However, the perceptrons A, B and C don't indicate their operation. In this quiz, set the correct operations for the perceptrons to calculate XOR.

**AND**, **OR**, **NOT**

| Perceptron | Operators |
| ---------- | --------- |
| A |  |
| B |  |
| C |  |
